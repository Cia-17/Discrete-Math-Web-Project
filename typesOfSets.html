          <h2>Types of Sets</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Universal sets:</strong>The set containing everything
            currently under consideration. Symbolized with U <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Empty sets or Null Set:</strong> The set with no elements.
            Symbolized ∅, but {} also used.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Singleton Set:</strong> A set with exactly one element.
            Example: {1}
            <br />
            A common error is to confuse the empty set ∅ with the set {∅}, which
            is a singleton set. The single element of the set {∅} is the empty
            set itself! A useful analogy for remembering this difference is to
            think of folders in a computer file system. The empty set can be
            thought of as an empty folder and the set consisting of just the
            empty set can be thought of as a folder with exactly one folder
            inside, namely, the empty folder
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Equal and Equivalent Sets:</strong> Two sets are equal if
            and only if they have the same elements.Therefore, if A and B are
            sets, then A and B are equal if and only if ∀x(x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B). We
            write A = B if A and B are equal sets. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Example:</strong> The sets {1,3,5} and {3,5,1} are equal,
            because they have the same elements. <br />
            <br />
            <strong> Note </strong> It does not matter if an element of a set is
            listed more than once; so {1,3,3,3,5,5,5,5} is the same as the set
            {1, 3,5} because they have the same elements. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Membership of sets:</strong> As established above a set
            contains element, thus, if an element "a" is found in the set A, we
            say that "a" is a member of A which is denoted as a ∈ B, however if
            "b" is not a member of B it is denoted as b ∉ B. <br /><strong
              >Note: </strong
            >Sets can have other sets as members. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Example:</strong> The set {N,Z,Q,R} is a set containing four
            elements, each of which is a set. The four elements of this set are
            N, the set of natural numbers; Z, the set of integers; Q, the set of
            rational numbers; and R, the set of real numbers.
