          <h2>Subsets</h2>
          <p>
            A set whose elements are all contained within another set. The set A
            is a subset of B , if and only if every element of A is also an
            element of B represented with the symbol A ⊆ B. However if there are
            elements in a set A that are not in set B. A is not a subset of B.
            This is denoted as A⊈B
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that to show that A is not a subset of B we only need to find a
            single x ∈ A such that x∈B. Also, this can be prooved by showing
            that if x belongs to A then x also belongs to B.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> Note: </strong> Every set is a subset of itself. The empty
            set is a subset of every set.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> Examples:</strong><br />
            1. The set of all odd positive integers less than 10 is a subset of
            the set of all positive integers less than 10. <br />
            2. The set of rational numbers is a subset of the set of real
            numbers.
            <br />
            3. The set of all computer science majors at your school is a subset
            of the set of all students at your school. <br />
          </p>

          </p>

          <p>
            <strong> Proper subset</strong>
            When we wish to emphasize that a set A is a subset of a set B but
            that A= B, we write A⊂B and say that A is a proper subset of B. For
            A ⊂ B to be true, it must be the case that A⊆B and there must exist
            an element x of B that is not an element of A. That is, A is a
            proper subset of B if and only if ∀x(x ∈ A →x ∈B) ∧ ∃x(x∈B ∧ x∈A)
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> Power Set: </strong> The set of all subsets of a given set
            including the empty set. The cardinality of a power set of n number
            of elements is 2n.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given a set S, the power set of S is the set of all subsets of the
            set S. <br />
            The power set of S is denoted by P(S). <br />
            <strong> Example:</strong><br />
            1. What is the power set of the set {0,1,2}? <br />
            <strong>Solution: </strong> The power set P({0,1,2}) is the set of
            all subsets of {0,1,2}. <br />
            Hence, P({0,1,2}) ={∅,{0},{1},{2},{0,1},{0,2},{1,2},{0,1,2}}.
            <br /><br />
            2. What is the power set of the set {∅}? <br />
            <strong>Solution:</strong> The empty set has exactly one subset,
            namely, itself. <br />
            Consequently, P(∅) = {∅}. The set {∅} has exactly two subsets,
            namely, ∅ and the set {∅} itself. Therefore, P({∅}) ={∅,{∅}}. If a
            set has n elements, then its power set has 2n elements.
